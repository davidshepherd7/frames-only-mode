If your issue is a bug, please provide me with some information to help reproduce it. If it's a feature request then
you can ignore this template.

## Reproducing

Please attempt to reproduce your bug [in `emacs -Q`](https://swsnr.de/blog/2015/11/29/reproduce-bugs-in-emacs-q/). If 
you do this and explain how you did it (or even better provide an elisp snippet) then it should be easy for me to 
do so too, and I'll be able to help! If you can't then it's likely to be an issue with your configuration. If you 
still need help you can give me your configuration and I'll have a look at it when I have some time, but please make 
sure you include everything relevant, ideally just point me to a repository containing the whole thing.
